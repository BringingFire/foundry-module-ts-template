# Foundry Module Template w/ Typescript

This repo is meant to be used as a starting point for creating your own FoundryVTT module with [Typescript][2]. If you are using Github you can get started by clicking the green `Use this template` button in the upper-right.

## Todo

If you have just created a new project with this template there are a few changes you should make to start:

- [ ] Update the values in `src/module.json`. At minimum you should change `id`, `title`, and `description`. It is also recommended that you add a `contacts` field.
- [ ] Update `moduleName` in `src/constants.ts` to match the new `id` in `src/module.json`
